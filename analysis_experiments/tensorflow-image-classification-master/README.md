# Tensorflow Image Classification
CNN for multi-class image recognition in tensorflow

Notebook converted from Hvass-Labs' <a href="https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/02_Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb" >tutorial</a> in order to work with custom datasets, flexible image dimensions, 3-channel images, training over epochs, early stopping, and a deeper network. 

This example uses Kaggle's cats vs. dogs <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data">dataset</a>.
